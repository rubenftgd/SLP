Comparing the results obtained for the energy of the residual: 
  - Considering the same values of window length and interval, the energy of the residual is smaller for a lower prediction order.
  - When the values for window length and interval are the closest and the biggest(20ms), that's when the residual energy is the smallest
If the residual energy is the smallest, the resynthesized signal will be more identical to the original signal, meaning that we will have 
a weaker residual.
